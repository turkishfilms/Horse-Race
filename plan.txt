"IDEA 1: Horse Racing WebApp"

BUGS & STUFF
-----------------
INTRO:
 - horse head is greyscale, and only becomes colored on slider input. should just be colored right away
 - horse head canvas background is white, should be clear so we can style it with css
TRAINING:
 - your horse's name counts up as if you were a duplicate when you go back and forth between intro and training
 - the big horse head across from the shotgun should be colored like your horse as well
 - the ready up icons don't reset(stay colored) if you go back to the training page
RACE END:
 - the "play again" button should return you to the training page. not the intro. So you can keep training the same horse
 - horse head should be colored like your horse
OTHERS:
 - at one point, the game thought I had 2 clients open. there was a ghost horse with a previous name that I couldn't get to go away. I haven't been able to repeat
-----------------


WISHLIST

TEAM:
TODO;
-tweak and decide on stats, training speed etc
-We need to add gambling or crypto into it somehow lol even if its in a silly way.
-NFT HORSES??
TODONE:
+ General stats
+ Training



General Stats:
    Weight: weight of horse; Effects Max Speed(+), Balance(-) and Acceleration(-)

    Speed: current speed

    Max speed: Max possible movement in one step. heavier horse = higher max speed. 

    acceleration: rate of speed increase. heavier horse = slower. 

    balance: chance of slipping per step. slipping means no movement (speed = 0 that turn). 

    place: horses current position in the race (first, second, third, etc)


Training:

    feed: increases weight (max speed). decreases acceleration.

    walk: increases balance, lowers weight

    rest: descreases weight, decreases balance


natural selection ideas:

    earn points from winning to spend on training.

    if horse weight gets too low (lose weight from losing race or training)
    then it dies and is deleted. 

    if horse reaches certain weight (max stat) and wins
    5 races in row it is put into hall of fame and retired


    or its more a .reduce like idea where uou keep playing
    until only one horse alive (collects all the other players stats)
    by winning and spending well while others slowly get drained
    then once you win your horse is put into hall of fame
MVP COMPLETED

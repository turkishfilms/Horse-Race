stats:

    weight: weight of horse

    speed: current speed

    max speed: max possible movement in one step. heavier horse = higher max speed. 

    acceleration: rate of speed increase. heavier horse = slower. 

    balance: chance of slipping per step. slipping means no movement (speed = 0 that turn). 

    place: horses current position in the race (first, second, third, etc)


ways to train stats:

    feed: increases weight (max speed). decreases acceleration.

    walk: increases balance, lowers weight

    rest: descreases weight, decreases balance

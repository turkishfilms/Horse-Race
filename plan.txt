stats:

    weight: weight of horse

    speed: current speed

    max speed: max possible movement in one step. heavier horse = higher max speed. 

    acceleration: rate of speed increase. heavier horse = slower. 

    balance: chance of slipping per step. slipping means no movement (speed = 0 that turn). 

    place: horses current position in the race (first, second, third, etc)


ways to train stats:

    feed: increases weight (max speed). decreases acceleration.

    walk: increases balance, lowers weight

    rest: descreases weight, decreases balance





natural selection ideas:

    earn points from winning to spend on training.

    if horse weight gets too low (lose weight from losing race or training)
    then it dies and is deleted. 

    if horse reaches certain weight (max stat) and wins
    5 races in row it is put into hall of fame and retired


    or its more a .reduce like idea where uou keep playing
    until only one horse alive (collects all the other players stats)
    by winning and spending well while others slowly get drained
    then once you win your horse is put into hall of fame
